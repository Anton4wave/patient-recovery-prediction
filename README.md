## Hackathon of the Graduate School of Business and VK

The task for VK Predict, a business unit of the company VK, involves developing a predictive model for a pharmaceutical company. This model should predict patient recovery based on test results, specifically for those treated with a new, expensive medication designed to replace a less effective, cheaper one.

## Tech stack
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for EDA
- SMOTE for Oversampling
- Polynomial features
- Feauture selection
- Optuna, GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
- CatBoost as a baseline approach
- Tensorflow Sequential for final model

## Usage

AI in developing medications:

- Analysis and processing large amounts of data speeds up and simplifies production process
- Objectivity of the received results allows you to avoid subjective judgments and choose the most optimal approach
- Process optimization clinical trials reduces time and costs for drug research and testing
- Finding Hidden Relationships in patient characteristics makes development possible personalized treatment plan
